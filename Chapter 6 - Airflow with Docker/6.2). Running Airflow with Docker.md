# Running Airflow on Docker.

A docker-compose .yaml file template for Celery can be found at:

https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/docker-compose.yaml

This can be opened and edited/configured in a text editor (i.e. VSCode).

This .yaml file is fairly self-explanatory in what each parameter does... Important notes:

* ```airflow-init``` - This section initialises a user/pwd for the Airflow webserver (default airflow/airflow).

* ```docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d``` - This is the bash command that will initialise our Docker instance.

* ```docker ps``` - Will list all docker containers that are running.
