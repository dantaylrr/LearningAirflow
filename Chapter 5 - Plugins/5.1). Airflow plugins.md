# Plugins.

What can you customise in Airflow?

* Operators - Allows you to create and modify your own custom operators, this can be an operator that extends the existing functionality of an operator, or a completely new operator.

* Views - Allows you to customise your UI amongst many other things.

* Hooks - You can create your own hook to interact with new tools or pieces of software.

How do we do this?

* Place all plugins in the plugin folder (this needs to be created).

* Then create the plugin by importing and using the AirflowPluginClass (pre Airflow 2.0).

* Post Airflow 2.0, you just need to create a regular Python module and import it.

* Plugins are lazy loaded - this just means you must restart Airflow to load it in.
