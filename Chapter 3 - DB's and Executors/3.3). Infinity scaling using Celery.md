#CeleryOperator.

As you can imagine, using the LocalOperator on the local machine, you will eventually run into resource constraints.

The CeleryOperator allows us to execute as many tasks, in parallel, as we need to.

Another executor, and one that will be a lot more widely used, is the **KubernetesOperator**.

Unfortunately, this course doesn't cover using the KubernetesExecutor, but the use-cases are similar.

**Note:** All executors use a *queue*.

When we split up DAGs, or tasks, across many different nodes or clusters, each task is distributed across each machine/node/worker in our cluster. This is elastically scaled depending on the task, and is the sole function of softwares such as Celery or Kubernetes.

The number of tasks each node or worker can take on is called its **concurrency**. i.e. if each node or worker has a concurrency of 2, then each node can take on 2 tasks.

In order to communicate each task between the nodes within your cluster, you also need a **message broker**, Celery & Kubernetes use Redis, so make sure you have that installed too.
