# Concurrency.

As mentioned prior, the concurrency of a node or worker indicates how many tasks it can take on when the DAG is split between all nodes in a cluster.

Now, we will explore some concurrency parameters that it's worth being aware of:

* Parallelism - Sets the max number of tasks that can run simultaneously on the airflow installation (default = 32).

* dag_concurrency - The number of tasks allowed to run concurrently by the scheduler in one DAG (default = 16).

* max_active_runs_per_dag - The maximum number of active DAG runs per DAG (default = 16).
