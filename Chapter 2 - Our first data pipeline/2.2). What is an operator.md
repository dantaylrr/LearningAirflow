# What is an operator.

Simply put, an operator defines **one task** in your data pipeline.

It is important to stress, and is best practice, that one operator should be responsible for only **one** task. Do not try to stretch your operators to more than one task.

### An example.

**Don't:**

|   Python Operator |
|---|
|  Cleaning Data |
| Processing Data  |

**Do:**

|   Python Operator |
|---|
|  Cleaning Data |

&

|   Python Operator |
|---|
|  Processing Data |

Why? If one of our tasks fails, let's say the processing of the data, if we want to retry the task, we will also have to retry the cleaning of the data task that was successful. ***This is extremely inefficient.***

### Types of operators.

Let's refresh ourselves on the 3 types of operators:

* **Action Operators** - Execute an action.
* **Transfer Operators** - Transfers data.
* **Sensors** - Wait for a condition to be met until moving to the next task.
