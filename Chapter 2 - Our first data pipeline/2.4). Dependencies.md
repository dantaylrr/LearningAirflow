# Dependencies.

We need to define the order of our DAG, we do these using ***Dependencies*** in the script.

Now, we sequence the name of our task_id's in the order that we want them executed, using the right big-shift ```>>``` operator as a funnel.

As an example:

```
creating_table >> is_api_available >> extracting_user >> processing_user >> storing_user
```

We can then validate that this configuration is correct by going to the Airflow UI:

DAGS -----> dag_id -----> Graph View

You should see arrows between each task, defining the dependencies.
