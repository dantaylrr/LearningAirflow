# Specifying a path in Airflow.

What if the output of a task determines the task that follows? What if the output of a task determines which path down a DAG we take?

It is a very common use case in Airflow to complete specific tasks based upon the outcome of another task.

Let's use the exact same example as just defined in 4.3). Exercises. That is, we randomly generate a model score between 0-10, now, let's set tasks that take that value, and determine whether the model is accurate (v > 5) or inaccurate (v <= 5).

### The BranchPythonOperator.

The above can be achieved by using the BranchPythonOperator. This operator works by setting defined output values to the branching task, in our case, let's say choose_model returns 'accurate', this will trigger our next task that has the same dag_id (or naming convention) - i.e. the next task will be called 'accurate'. This will also skip the inaccurate task.
