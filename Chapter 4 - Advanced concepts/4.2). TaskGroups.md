# TaskGroups.

As with the previous section, we saw that grouping tasks is possible & can be powerful through the use of SubDAGs. This however, isn't recommended for DAGs in production:

* SubDAGs add complexity to our DAGs.

* SubDAGs can only use the SequentialExecutor.

* SubDAGs can lead to *Deadlocks*.

However, with the introduction of Airflow 2.0, there is a new method named **TaskGroups**.

In order to use TaskGroup, we first need to import it from the utils folder:

```from airflow.utils.task_group import TaskGroup```

When compared to SubDAGs, the main advantage is that you do not have to create a separate python function & script to group your DAGs, it can all be done within the same driver script.

Now, we will revisit the exact same example as before, but instead group the tasks using TaskGroup, see 4.2). Exercises to demonstrate how much cleaner, simpler & efficient this method is.
