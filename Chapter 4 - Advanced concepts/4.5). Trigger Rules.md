# Trigger Rules.

You can change the default behaviour of your tasks, more specifically, you can change how a task is getting triggered by changing its trigger rule.

There are 9 different trigger rules in Airflow, here are some of them:

* all_success - This is the default trigger rule, and specifies that a task can start when all the previous tasks it depends on have succeeded.

* all_failed - Here, we want to trigger our task when all of our previous tasks have failed (maybe a logging task?).

* all_done - As long as the upstream tasks get triggered, then our task will also be triggered no matter the outcomes.

* one_ success - As long as one upstream task has succeeded, our task can be triggered.

* one_failed - As long as one upstream task has failed, our task can be triggered.

* none_failed - As long as **ALL** upstream tasks have either been successfully completed **OR** skipped, our task will be triggered.

* none_failed_or_skipped - As long as upstream tasks haven't failed, but at least one has succeeded, our task will be triggered.
