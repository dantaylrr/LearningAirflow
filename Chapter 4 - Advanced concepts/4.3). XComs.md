# XComs.

What if we want to share data between our tasks? What if we want to use the result from one task in another? How do we ensure that our memory isn't broken or exceeded?

The typical was we would do this would be to push the results from one task to an external source such as a database or S3 bucket, and pull that data in the next task.

However, we can also use something called **XComs** if the data we are exchanging is **SMALL**.

The main thing to consider with XComs is that you'll have to create a bespoke function that pushes and pulls your values to and from each task. This can be seen in 4.3). Excercises.

This is done through two main functions, that do exactly as they say on the tin:

* ```ti.xcom_push``` - Push data from the task instance in which the function is defined.

* ```ti.xcom_pull``` - Pull data from the task instance in which the function is defined.
